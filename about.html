                <p class="lead text-center">DiTTA (Digital Twin Technology for Aerospace Engineering) is an innovative
                    technology project developed by Cal Poly Pomona aimed at creating advanced digital twin technology
                    for
                    aerospace engineering applications. The primary objective of the CPP-DiTTA project is to develop a
                    technology demonstrator for a digital twin, which serves as a computational model of a physical
                    asset
                    updated with real-time sensory data. This concept is of significant interest to the aerospace
                    community,
                    including the US Air Force and private companies, as it offers substantial benefits in terms of
                    maintenance
                    cost reduction and improved decision-making through live health monitoring and predictive analysis.

                    The first iteration of the project, CPP-DiTTA 1.0, involved developing a digital twin of an aluminum
                    plate.
                    This system was capable of predicting the location of damage on the plate using real-time sensory
                    data and
                    producing a three-dimensional visualization of the deformed configuration under specific loads. The
                    initial
                    results were reported at SciTech 2024. Building on this success, CPP-DiTTA 2.0 focuses on a more
                    complex
                    composite plate and aims to detect internal delamination defects using real-time sensor data. The
                    enhanced
                    version will be showcased at SciTech 2025.

                    Digital twins provide a tail number-specific computational model of physical assets, continuously
                    updated
                    based on sensory data throughout the asset's life. This live monitoring system helps in identifying
                    and
                    predicting in-service damage, such as internal delamination, which can occur due to mechanical
                    impacts and
                    environmental conditions. The project uses advanced finite element analysis (FEA) and machine
                    learning (ML)
                    algorithms to detect and visualize these defects. High-fidelity simulation models are built to study
                    various
                    damage scenarios, which then inform the ML models used in the decision-making module of the digital
                    twin.

                    The CPP-DiTTA system architecture comprises several key components: the physical asset (a composite
                    plate in
                    the latest version), a digital twin that updates at regular intervals based on sensory data, and a
                    virtual
                    reality module for intuitive visualization. The physical asset is equipped with sensors to measure
                    stress
                    and deformation, with data being fed into high-fidelity simulations and ML models. These models,
                    including
                    decision trees and neural networks, predict the location and extent of damage, providing critical
                    insights
                    into the asset's health.

                    The visualization module, developed using the Unity 3D game engine, allows users to interact with
                    the
                    digital twin in a virtual environment, enhancing the understanding of simulation results. This
                    integration
                    of real-time data, advanced simulations, and intuitive visualization makes DiTTA a powerful tool for
                    research, education, and practical applications in aerospace engineering, offering a comprehensive
                    solution
                    for digital twin technology.
